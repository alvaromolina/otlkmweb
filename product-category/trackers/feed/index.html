Main function of VTrack L GPS tracker: overspeed alarm, main shutdown alarm, remote oil control and power failure. GPS/GSM station positioning. Remote control with on/off function. Car GPS tracker with SOS button and voice monitor with microphone.

<strong>Main functions:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>The tracker is activated periodically, calculates the geolocation through GPS and stores it in the memory or sends the last positions.</li>
 	<li>Static mode: the tracker is activated in this mode after X minutes of sleep. It calculates the GPS position, sends it via GSM, then goes back to sleep for another X minutes. At any time during sleep, the accelerometer has the ability to wake up the tracker if it detects movement within a certain threshold. In such a case, the tracker immediately moves to "motion mode".</li>
 	<li>Motion mode: the tracker wakes up due to two possible reasons: due to the accelerometer; or after X minutes of sleep. The tracker calculates the GPS position and sends it via GSM. Before going to sleep, it compares the current position with the previous one: if it is a different location, the tracker sleeps for another X minutes; If it is the same location, the tracker moves to "static mode" and sleeps for X minutes.</li>
 	<li>If GPS triangulation is not possible, the system switches to GSM and triangulates the position via nearby radio bases.</li>
</ul>]]></description>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those responsible for the cyber-attack are making extortive charges to the company to decrypt the files. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information and customer databases of the Municipal Companies of Cali have been endangered, due to the infection of the commercial system equipment with a malicious virus. It entered through a computer that is part of an interconnected network that has shared folders, so all the files were encrypted with a password, and in exchange for releasing them, those responsible for the virus are asking between 50,000 and 100,000 dollars. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The virus leaves a file which is where it gives you the instructions of what they are aiming for. It says: if you want to recover your data, write to one of these two emails and make a payment in Bitcoin because this cryptocurrency is more difficult to trace.&#8221; </span></p>

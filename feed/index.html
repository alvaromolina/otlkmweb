										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ukrainian software developer Volodymyr Kvaschuk was sentenced to nine years in prison due to his involvement in stealing more than $10 million from Microsoft. The verdict was issued in 2020, but the details of this investigation were not known until now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The defendant worked at Microsoft between August 2016 and June 2018 and previously worked as a quality assurance evaluator on the Universal Store team. In this position, employees have the ability to create accounts using dedicated email addresses and credit cards. This allowed him to make free purchases with discount cards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The individual purchased gift cards through his account, after which their value could be credited to his account and receive a discount in the digital or offline Microsoft Store. But Kvashchuk went even further, using the scheme for personal gain: selling digital cards to third parties. According to prosecutors, he caused the company a $10 million loss by trading promotional codes at prices far below their actual value. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to investigators, once a programmer began selling so many codes, the prices of Xbox gift cards were driven throughout the reseller market. Two years later, Kwashchuk had already stolen more than 150,000 cards totaling $10 million. During this time he managed to buy a Tesla automobile for $162,899 and a house on Lake Washington worth more than $1, 600,000. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information and customer databases of the Municipal Companies of Cali have been endangered, due to the infection of the commercial system equipment with a malicious virus. It entered through a computer that is part of an interconnected network that has shared folders, so all the files were encrypted with a password, and in exchange for releasing them, those responsible for the virus are asking between 50,000 and 100,000 dollars. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The virus leaves a file which is where it gives you the instructions of what they are aiming for. It says: if you want to recover your data, write to one of these two emails and make a payment in Bitcoin because this cryptocurrency is more difficult to trace.&#8221; </span></p>

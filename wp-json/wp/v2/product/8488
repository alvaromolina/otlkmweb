It calculates the GPS position, sends it via GSM, then goes back to sleep for another X minutes. At any time during sleep, the accelerometer has the ability to wake up the tracker if it detects movement within a certain threshold. In such a case, the tracker immediately moves to &#8220;motion mode&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>Motion mode: the tracker wakes up due to two possible reasons: due to the accelerometer; or after X minutes of sleep. The tracker calculates the GPS position and sends it via GSM. Before going to sleep, it compares the current position with the previous one: if it is a different location, the tracker sleeps for another X minutes; If it is the same location, the tracker moves to &#8220;static mode&#8221; and sleeps for X minutes.<\/li>\n<li>If GPS triangulation is not possible, the system switches to GSM and triangulates the position via nearby radio bases.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":13586,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"site-sidebar-layout":"default","site-content-layout":"default","ast-main-header-display":"","ast-hfb-above-header-display":"","ast-hfb-below-header-display":"","ast-hfb-mobile-header-display":"","site-post-title":"","ast-breadcrumbs-content":"","ast-featured-img":"","footer-sml-layout":"","theme-transparent-header-meta":"","adv-header-id-meta":"","stick-header-meta":"","header-above-stick-meta":"","header-main-stick-meta":"","header-below-stick-meta":""},"product_cat":[42],"product_tag":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/msiamericas.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product\/8488"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/msiamericas.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/msiamericas.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/product"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/msiamericas.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8488"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/msiamericas.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/13586"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/msiamericas.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8488"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"product_cat","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/msiamericas.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product_cat?post=8488"},{"taxonomy":"product_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/msiamericas.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product_tag?post=8488"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

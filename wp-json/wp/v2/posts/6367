But Kvashchuk went even further, using the scheme for personal gain: selling digital cards to third parties. According to prosecutors, he caused the company a $10 million loss by trading promotional codes at prices far below their actual value.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to investigators, once a programmer began selling so many codes, the prices of Xbox gift cards were driven throughout the reseller market.
